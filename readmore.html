<h1>Types of Coffee</h1>
<p> <b> Types of Coffee Beans<b>
Coffee is a brewed drink made from coffee beans, which are actually the roasted seeds of the coffee plant. The species of bean used, where it was sourced from, and how it was roasted will all affect the taste and aroma of the final cup you'll sip. The two main categories of coffee beans you'll come across are Arabica and Robusta. So what's the difference?

Arabica
You may have seen bags of coffee labeled "100 percent Arabica." Arabica is the most popular type of bean used for coffee. Arabica beans are considered higher quality than Robusta, and they're also more expensive. They result in coffee with a sweeter, less harsh taste.

Robusta
Robusta beans are typically cheaper to produce because the Robusta plant is easier to grow. They have a higher caffeine content and taste more bitter than Arabica beans. These beans are often used to make instant coffee and espresso blends.

Types of Hot Coffee Drinks
Black Coffee
No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings.

Decaf
Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.

Espresso
Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor. A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.

Latte
types of coffee latte
BUFF STRICKLAND
This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!

Cappuccino
This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker. The standard ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a 6-ounce cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.

Macchiato
A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just a touch of steamed milk or foam. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted," so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been stained with milk.



Americano
Order this drink and you'll get a shot of espresso diluted with hot water.

Café au Lait
This fancy-sounding French drink is actually super simple: It's equal parts coffee and steamed or scalded milk.

Cortado
This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many Italian coffee drinks, it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce glass.

Flat White
Like the latte, this drink consists of espresso and steamed milk, but the ratio of espresso to milk is higher. Baristas also fold the milk as it steams, which creates a more velvety texture. The flat white has roots in Australia and New Zealand.

Mocha Latte
This sweet twist on the latte is flavored with sugar and chocolate, usually in the form of cocoa powder, melted chocolate, or syrup.

Red Eye
When you need an extra caffeine boost, go for this two-in-one drink: It's coffee with a shot of espresso.

This boozy drink is a combination of black coffee, whiskey, and sugar, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Ree's mom used to make Irish coffee all the time, and now Ree does, too.

Types of Cold Coffee Drinks
Iced Coffee
Is there anything better than a glass of iced coffee on a hot day (or any day, for that matter)? The simplest way to make it: Brew a regular cup of hot coffee, then cool it over ice. Add whatever milk and sweeteners you like.

Iced Latte
The chilled version of a latte is simply espresso and milk over ice.

Cold Brew
how to make cold brew coffee
RALPH SMITH


Cold brew is one of the biggest coffee trends of the last decade, and for good reason: It's made by slowly steeping coffee grounds over cool or room-temperature water, so it tastes smoother and less bitter than regular iced coffee, which is brewed hot.

Ree discovered the method more than a decade ago and has been making her perfect iced coffee that way ever since! Keep in mind that cold brew is more concentrated than iced coffee, so it's often more caffeinated. You can dilute it with milk or cream. Here's how to make cold brew coffee at home.

Nitro Cold Brew
Cutting-edge coffee roasters developed this newer type of cold brew using techniques from the beer industry: It's infused with nitrogen bubbles, so it has a frothy, beer-like texture. Trendy coffee houses dispense nitro cold brew from taps, and you can buy it by the can from brands like RISE Brewing Co. and Starbucks.

Frappe
This word can be used to describe a variety of coffee and espresso drinks that have been blended with ice. The slushy-like drinks often contain some kind of milk and a flavored syrup, plus a top layer of whipped cream. If you're like Ree and don't have a Starbucks down the block, try her homemade Frappuccino recipe!
